Project: Service Booking Platform - Production Goals & Missing Features

1. Payments & Financials
   - Payment Gateway Integration (Stripe, Razorpay, or PayPal) for secure transactions.
   - Vendor Payout System (Automated transfers, commission management).
   - Invoicing & Receipt Generation for customers.
   - Refund handling logic based on cancellation policies.

2. Advanced Authentication & Security
   - Email Verification / Phone OTP on registration. (Discussed: Nodemailer for email is a good first step).
   - Secure Password Reset flow (Email links). (Discussed: Nodemailer is the recommended approach).
   - Refresh Token implementation for better session security.
   - OAuth Integration (Google/Facebook Login).
   - Rate Limiting to prevent abuse.

3. Enhanced Booking Experience
   - Service Availability Calendar: Vendors define working hours/slots.
   - Rescheduling functionality for bookings.
   - In-app Chat System: Real-time communication between Customer and Vendor.
   - er & Vendor Profiles
   - Customer Profile Editing (Avatar, Phone, Address management).
   - Vendor KYC: Document upload (ID, License) for verification.
   - Service Gallery: Vendors uploading multiple images for their work.

5. Search & Discovery
   - Map View: Search services on a map interface.
   - Advanced Filtering: Price range, Rating, Availability.
   - Location-based sorting (Distance).

6. Technical & DevOps
   - Automated Testing (Unit & Integration tests).
   - Error Logging & Monitoring (e.g., Sentry).
   - CI/CD Pipeline setup.
   - SEO Optimization (Meta tags, Sitemap).
   - Accessibility Compliance (WCAG).
   - Data Export: Allow Admins to export booking/user data to CSV/Excel.
   - Input Validation: Comprehensive backend validation (Zod/Joi) for all forms. (IN PROGRESS)

7. Codebase Refactoring & Cleanup (Immediate)
   - Remove hardcoded API URLs (e.g., 'http://localhost:5000') in Services.tsx and AdminDashboard.tsx; use environment variables.
   - Remove mock data fallbacks in AdminDashboard.tsx (fetchAnalytics) to prevent misleading data display on API failure.
   - Unify Service Categories: Register.tsx uses a hardcoded list while VendorProfile.tsx fetches from API. Both should fetch from API.
   - Security: Sanitize backend error messages (bookings.js) to avoid exposing internal stack traces or database errors to the client.

8. Admin Panel Enhancements
   - Category Management: View, edit image URLs, and upload new images for service categories. (COMPLETED)
